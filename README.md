# Explanation:
The code first imports the math and random modules to make use of their functionalities.

It then prompts the user to input a number (N) and converts it to a float.

The square root of the input number (N) is calculated using the math.sqrt() function and stored in R. The result is printed with two decimal places.

The factorial of the input number (N) is calculated using the math.factorial() function, after converting N to an integer. The result is printed.

Next, the code calculates the factorial of the integer square root of N (math.sqrt(N)). This is achieved by taking the square root of N, converting it to an integer, and then calculating the factorial. The result is printed.

Finally, the code generates a random integer between 1 and 10 using the random.randint() function and prints it.
